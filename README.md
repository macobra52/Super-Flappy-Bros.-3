Coming full circle in 2025, this is a romhack of SMB3 that incorporates most of the concepts behind the hit mobile game Flappy Bird. It is a short one world, eight level hack intended more as a proof-of-concept that also includes a developer patch, allowing you to design your own levels with these changes!

# Core ASM Changes

- You always start levels with a P-wing equipped
- You always constantly move to the right, regardless of your directional input
- Taking any damage instantly defeats you
- Touching the bottom or sides or any object instantly defeats you
- Touching water instantly defeats you

Note that unlike in Flappy Bird, you can still land on objects and you still have access to all of your normal moves while in the air. It is highly recommended to take advantage of this, especially in later levels!

# Instructions

Simply apply the correct IPS patch to your original unmodified SMB3 game, depending on which version you have (PRG0 or PRG1).

# Special Thanks

- Captain Southbird for the SMB3 Disassembly, which none of this would be possible without!
- WilsonPenn for the Quick Death patch
- OrangeExpo for the Death Counter patch
- Michael and Joe Smo for the editor tools to make this possible

# Enjoy!
