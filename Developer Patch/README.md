# Changes Included

- You always start levels with a P-wing equipped
- You always constantly move to the right, regardless of your directional input
- Taking any damage instantly defeats you
- Touching the bottom or sides or any object instantly defeats you
- Going too far to the right instantly defeats you (Example: Missing the end level card)
- Boom Boom instantly drops their orb (no Boom Boom fight)
- The Bowser door opens right away (no Bowser fight)

# Notes

- You can still touch the ground and the top of objects, since it is normally required when grabbing the end of level card
- Autoscrolling levels will not work without additional changes, since you move faster than the autoscroll (and touching the right edge will defeat you)
- Additional changes will be required if you want additional player restrictions (no ducking, no speed increase with B, no tail swipe, no carrying things, etc.)
- The Bowser door is coded to appear in the specific vanilla location (x and y) relative to the screen scroll. Additional changes will be required if the door is moved
